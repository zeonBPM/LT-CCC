Lex Talionis Community Components Compilation

A compendium for all custom components for the engine Lex Talionis

Over time hopefully it will be a place to find all components in one place, instead of having to use the barely functional discord search.

I intend to include engine hacking eventually so common modifications(like highlighting personal skills) are added, but it is not the focus.

This is a plublic repo and everyone can make a request to add a component, just do it by github or send to zeonBPM#1222 over discord



#I WILL NOT ADD ANY COMPONENT MYSELF UNLESS REQUESTED BY THE AUTHOR
